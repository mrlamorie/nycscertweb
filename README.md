# Hunter CS Ed
The Hunter CS-Ed program is for current teachers who have intrest in or are currently teching computer science. The program is largely based in Java, as APCS is a java based course, and many of the teachers involved in the course are teaching students/will be teaching students who are in the CS AP class. Work was done using repl.it, all example code below goes to the repl.it page for the code

### Prework -
The prework portion of the program was required work before entry into the program. Much of this work alligns with SUNY transfer requirements for CS 1. Prsented here are a few of the more complex projects for this course - 
1. [Craps](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#programming/Prework/8/Craps.java) - this game of craps can be run with a number of games added at the run line, or prompted after the program is run.
1. [Seive of Eratosthenes](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#programming/Prework/7/Sieve.java) - a function to find all of the prime numbers between 0 and a number (non-inclusive)
