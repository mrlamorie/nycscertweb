# Hunter CS Ed
The Hunter CS-Ed program is for current teachers who have intrest in or are currently teching computer science. The program is largely based in Java, as APCS is a java based course, and many of the teachers involved in the course are teaching students/will be teaching students who are in the CS AP class. Work was done using repl.it, all example code below goes to the repl.it page for the code

## Courses

### Prework -
The prework portion of the program was required work before entry into the program. Much of this work alligns with SUNY transfer requirements for CS 1. Prsented here are a few of the more complex projects for this course - 
1. [Craps](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#programming/Prework/8/Craps.java) - this game of craps can be run with a number of games added at the run line, or prompted after the program is run.
1. [Seive of Eratosthenes](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#programming/Prework/7/Sieve.java) - a function to find all of the prime numbers between 0 and a number (non-inclusive)

### Programming in a Higher Language -
This course continues work in what Aligns with CS 1 in the SUNY transfer requirements, as well as CS 2. Some example projects for this course are - 
1. [Rational Number Math](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#programming/6/rat/Rational.java) - a program that allows the user to work with rational numbers & get outputs in either rational form or floating point form.
1. [ReversR](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#programming/5/Reverser.java) - a recursive method to reverse strings.

### Data Strutures
This course continues work in what aligns with CS 2 in the SUNY transfer requirements and CS 3 as well. Some sample projects include -
1. [Linked List](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#ds/LinkedLists/LinkedList.java) - a student implimentation of a single linked list. See also the [driver](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#ds/LinkedLists/Driver.java) for test cases and examples of the program running
1. [SortSearch](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#ds/Sorting/SortSearch.java) - (Work in progress) currently this file has a linear search implimentation, a binary search, a recursive binary search, and a sort in place. When finished, this will also have a mergeSort implimentation. See also the [driver](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#ds/Sorting/SortSearchDriver.java) for test cases and examples of the program running

### Methods
This course is a look at methods of teaching in computer science. It focuses on diffrent ways we might engage the students in the learning proces. Some sample projects include-
1. [Live Coding in P5 Activity](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#methods/02_livecode_P5.md) - an outline for an activity using resouces from Kate Maschmeyer[^1] to live code a simple game in P5 as a directed activity with students.
1. [Nested Looping](https://replit.com/@mrlamorie/cohort-3-summer-work-mrlamorie#methods/06_scaffold_activity.md) - an adaption of a lession I teach into Java using "Code skeletons" or "Code scaffolds", where the format, spacing, and indenting of comments serve as prompts to the students on how they should code and what the objective is.
